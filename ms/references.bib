@article{romano_behavior_1990,
	Abstract = {Fisher's randomization construction of hypothesis tests is a powerful tool to yield tests that are nonparametric in nature in that their level is exactly equal to the nominal level in finite samples over a wide range of distributional assumptions. For example, the usual permutation t test to test equality of means is valid without a normality assumption of the underlying populations. On the other hand, Fisher's randomization construction is not applicable in this example unless the underlying populations differ only in location. In general, the basis for the randomization construction is invariance of the probability distribution of the data under a transformation group. It is the goal of this article to understand the robustness properties of randomization tests by studying their asymptotic validity in situations where the basis for their construction breaks down. Here, asymptotic validity refers to whether the probability of a Type I error tends asymptotically to the nominal level. In particular, it is shown that the randomization construction is generally asymptotically valid for certain one-sample problems, such as for testing a mean or a median, even when the underlying population is not symmetric. In contrast, the randomization construction for two-sample problems may yield invalid tests, though it depends on the precise nature of the problem. For example, the two-sample permutation test based on sample means is generally asymptotically valid only if the samples are of the same size. When comparing medians, however, the two-sample permutation test is generally invalid even if the sample sizes are equal.},

	Abstract = {A survey of 252 prospective, comparative studies reported in five, frequently cited biomedical journals revealed that experimental groups were constructed by randomization in 96\% of cases and by random sampling in only 4\%. The median group sizes ranged from 4 to 12. In the randomized studies in which measurements were made on a continuous scale, comparisons of location were made by t or F tests in 84\% of cases, and by nonparametric, rank-order, tests in the remainder. Because randomization rather than random sampling is the norm in biomedical research and because group sizes are usually small, exact permutation or randomization tests for differences in location should be preferred to t or F tests.},

@article{winter_five-point_2010,
	Abstract = {Likert questionnaires are widely used in survey research, but it is unclear whether the item data should be investigated by means of parametric or nonparametric procedures. This study compared the Type I and II error rates of the "t" test versus the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) for five-point Likert items. Fourteen population distributions were defined and pairs of samples were drawn from the populations and submitted to the "t" test and the "t" test on ranks, which yields the same results as MWW. The results showed that the two tests had equivalent power for most of the pairs. MWW had a power advantage when one of the samples was drawn from a skewed or peaked distribution. Strong power differences between the "t" test and MWW occurred when one of the samples was drawn from a multimodal distribution. Notably, the Type I error rate of both methods was never more than 3\% above the nominal rate of 5\%, even not when sample sizes were highly unequal. In conclusion, for five-point Likert items, the "t" test and MWW generally have similar power, and researchers do not have to worry about finding a difference whilst there is none in the population.

	Abstract = {It has generally been argued that parametric statistics should not be applied to data with non-normal distributions. Empirical research has demonstrated that Mann-Whitney generally has greater power than the t-test unless data are sampled from the normal. In the case of randomized trials, we are typically interested in how an endpoint, such as blood pressure or pain, changes following treatment. Such trials should be analyzed using ANCOVA, rather than t-test. The objectives of this study were: a) to compare the relative power of Mann-Whitney and ANCOVA; b) to determine whether ANCOVA provides an unbiased estimate for the difference between groups; c) to investigate the distribution of change scores between repeat assessments of a non-normally distributed variable.},

@article{anderson_permutation_2001,
	Abstract = {Several approximate permutation tests have been proposed for tests of partial regression coefficients in a linear model based on sample partial correlations. This paper begins with an explanation and notation for an exact test. It then compares the distributions of the test statistics under the various permutation methods proposed, and shows that the partial correlations under permutation are asymptotically jointly normal with means 0 and variances 1. The method of Freedman \& Lane (1983) is found to have asymptotic correlation 1 with the exact test, and the other methods are found to have smaller correlations with this test. Under local alternatives the critical values of all the approximate permutation tests converge to the same constant, so they all have the same asymptotic power. Simulations demonstrate these theoretical results.},

@article{anderson_permutation_2001-1,
	Abstract = {The most appropriate strategy to be used to create a permutation distribution for tests of individual terms in complex experimental designs is currently unclear. There are often many possibilities, including restricted permutation or permutation of some form of residuals. This paper provides a summary of recent empirical and theoretical results concerning available methods and gives recommendations for their use in univariate and multivariate applications. The focus of the paper is on complex designs in analysis of variance and multiple regression (i.e., linear models). The assumption of exchangeability required for a permutation test is assured by random allocation of treatments to units in experimental work. For observational data, exchangeability is tantamount to the assumption of independent and identically distributed errors under a null hypothesis. For partial regression, the method of permutation of residuals under a reduced model has been shown to provide the best test.

@article{anderson_empirical_1999,
	Abstract = {This study compared empirical type I error and power of different permutation techniques for the test of significance of a single partial regression coefficient in a multiple regression model, using simulations. The methods compared were permutation of raw data values, two alternative methods proposed for permutation of residuals under the reduced model, and permutation of residuals under the full model. The normal-theory t-test was also included in simulations. We investigated effects of (1) the sample size, (2) the degree of collinearity between the predictor variables, (3) the size of the covariable's parameter, (4) the distribution of the added random error and (5) the presence of an outlier in the covariable on these methods. We found that two methods that had been identified as equivalent formulations of permutation under the reduced model were actually quite different. One of these methods resulted in consistently inflated type 1 error. In addition, when the covariable contained an extreme outlier, permutation of raw data resulted in unstable (often inflated) type 1 error. There were no significant differences in power among the three permutation methods (raw data permutation, reduced-model permutation and full-model permutation), but all had greater power than the normal-theory t-;test when errors were non-normal. The reduced model permutation method had the most consistent and reliable results of the methods investigated here for the test of a partial regression coefficient. However, reasonably extreme situations needed to be simulated in order to distinguish methods from the normal-theory t-test and from one another. Permutation of raw data, permutation under the reduced model, and permutation under the full model are generally asymptotically equivalent.},

	Abstract = {Freedman [Adv. in Appl. Math. 40 (2008) 180--193; Ann. Appl. Stat. 2 (2008) 176--196] critiqued ordinary least squares regression adjustment of estimated treatment effects in randomized experiments, using Neyman's model for randomization inference. Contrary to conventional wisdom, he argued that adjustment can lead to worsened asymptotic precision, invalid measures of precision, and small-sample bias. This paper shows that in sufficiently large samples, those problems are either minor or easily fixed. OLS adjustment cannot hurt asymptotic precision when a full set of treatment--covariate interactions is included. Asymptotically valid confidence intervals can be constructed with the Huber--White sandwich standard error estimator. Checks on the asymptotic approximations are illustrated with data from Angrist, Lang, and Oreopoulos's [Am. Econ. J.: Appl. Econ. 1:1 (2009) 136--163] evaluation of strategies to improve college students' achievement. The strongest reasons to support Freedman's preference for unadjusted estimates are transparency and the dangers of specification search.},

As a result, the reported significance levels become difficult to interpret. This article sketches an alternative interpretation of a reported significance level, valid in considerable generality. This level locates the given data set within the spectrum of other data sets derived from the given one by an appropriate class of transformations. If the null hypothesis being tested holds, the derived data sets should be equivalent to the original one. Thus, a small reported significance level indicates an unusual data set. This development parallels that of randomization tests, but there is a crucial technical difference: our approach involves permuting observed residuals; the classical randomization approach involves permuting unobservable, or perhaps nonexistent, stochastic disturbance terms.},

@article{frison_repeated_1992,
	Abstract = {This paper explores the use of simple summary statistics for analysing repeated measurements in randomized clinical trials with two treatments. Quite often the data for each patient may be effectively summarized by a pre-treatment mean and a post-treatment mean. Analysis of covariance is the method of choice and its superiority over analysis of post-treatment means or analysis of mean changes is quantified, as regards both reduced variance and avoidance of bias, using a simple model for the covariance structure between time points. Quantitative consideration is also given to practical issues in the design of repeated measures studies: the merits of having more than one pre-treatment measurement are demonstrated, and methods for determining sample sizes in repeated measures designs are provided. Several examples from clinical trials are presented, and broad practical recommendations are made. The examples support the value of the compound symmetry assumption as a realistic simplification in quantitative planning of repeated measures trials. The analysis using summary statistics makes no such assumption. However, allowance in design for alternative non-equal correlation structures can and should be made when necessary.},
